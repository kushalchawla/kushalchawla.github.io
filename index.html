<br>I am a PhD student (starting Fall’19) at the <a href="https://ict.usc.edu/" target="_blank">Institute for Creative Technologies (ICT) </a>, <a href="https://www.usc.edu/" target="_blank"> University of Southern California (USC)</a>. I am advised by <a href="https://ict.usc.edu/profile/gale-lucas/" target="_blank">Gale Lucas</a> and <a href="https://ict.usc.edu/profile/jonathan-gratch/" target="_blank">Jonathan Gratch</a>. I am currently interested in the overlap between Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), focusing on enabling agent-human negotiations through Natural Language.<br><br>

Prior to USC, I pursued my Bachelors in Computer Science from the Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati (IITG). After graduating in 2017, I spent a couple of years with Adobe Research, focusing on NLP applications in marketing, including affect modelling and text summarization.<br><br>
