<br>I am a PhD student (starting Fall’19) at the <a href="https://ict.usc.edu/">Institute for Creative Technologies (ICT) </a>, <a href="https://www.usc.edu/"> University of Southern California (USC)</a>. I am advised by <a href="https://ict.usc.edu/profile/gale-lucas/">Gale Lucas</a> and <a href="https://ict.usc.edu/profile/jonathan-gratch/">Jonathan Gratch</a>. I am currently interested in the overlap between Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), focusing on enabling agent-human negotiations through Natural Language.<br><br>

Prior to USC, I pursued my Bachelors in Computer Science from the Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati (IITG). After graduating in 2017, I spent a couple of years with Adobe Research, focusing on NLP applications in marketing, including affect modelling and text summarization.<br><br>

<!--When I’m not doing ML, I like to work out, climb boulders, play guitar, and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/62772844-desh-raj?shelf=read&sort=date_read">read fiction</a>.-->
