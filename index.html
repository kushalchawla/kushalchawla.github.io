<br>I am a PhD student at the <a href="https://ict.usc.edu/" target="_blank">Institute for Creative Technologies (ICT) </a>, <a href="https://www.usc.edu/" target="_blank">University of Southern California (USC)</a>. I am advised by <a href="https://ict.usc.edu/profile/gale-lucas/" target="_blank">Gale Lucas</a> and <a href="https://ict.usc.edu/profile/jonathan-gratch/" target="_blank">Jonathan Gratch</a>. I am also guided by <a href="https://www.isi.edu/~jonmay/" target="_blank">Jonathan May</a>. I am currently interested in the overlap between Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), focusing on enabling agent-human negotiations through Natural Language.<br><br>

I pursued my undergraduate in Computer Science from the <a href="https://www.iitg.ac.in/" target="_blank"> Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati (IITG)</a>. After graduating in 2017, I spent a couple of years with <a href="https://research.adobe.com/research/natural-language-processing/" target="_blank">Adobe Research</a>, focusing on NLP applications in marketing, including affect modeling and text summarization.<br><br>
